# COMSOL CFD Models for Spiral Wound Membrane Study

This repository contains computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models developed using COMSOL Multiphysics for the study titled:
"Novel-Design-for-a-More-Efficient-Spiral-Wound-Membrane"

These models were used to investigate the impact of spacer arrangement and membrane leaf geometry on flow behavior, concentration polarization, and energy efficiency in spiral wound membrane (SWM) modules.
